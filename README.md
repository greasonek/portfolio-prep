Emily Greason - Software Developer
Before I decided to change careers into the tech industry, I worked in operations management where I nurtured a skill set that allowed me to become adept at developing streamlined solutions to complex problems and I became proficient in time management and organization at a company wide level. I was able to increase my company's monthly revenue by over 100% month over month for two consecutive years and oversaw a complete company rebrand that included bringing on company-wide healthcare for all employees. I decided to change careers to pursue software development because I would like to work in an industry that values problem solving, provides a challenge and promotes growth. I chose this because I am interested in front end web-development, how websites and apps are designed and the thought process and skill that goes into developing the user experience. I'd love to work in an environment where I am surrounded by individuals who are diverse in what we all bring to the table, yet like minded in sharing a common goal. I believe my ability to work independently while maintaining a team player mindset will be beneficial as I merge into a career in tech.

I love designing and building something that is funcitonl and accessible. Websites and applications give the user accessible information anywhere in the world and I love being a part of making that possible.
